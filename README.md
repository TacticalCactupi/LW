Welcome to Location Watchdog's GitHub Page!

Feel free to commit, fork, etc. here. For info
on the plugin, look at the Bukkit page.

Thanks to all the help from #bukkitdev irc. Also,
thanks to the MySQL connection bridge by -_Husky_-, which
is publicly available on forums.bukkit.org.

Please note: LocationWatchdog doesn't, and likely never will,
use UUIDs to log locations. If your concerned about a player 
getting another player banned, install a plugin that traces
all UUIDs a player has used on your server to be safe.
